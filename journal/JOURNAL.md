[my_task_was] = Implement additional Python-specific and Flask-specific attack patterns (TODO.md lines 309-325)
[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Successfully implemented 7 new attack patterns: 1) weak_cryptography.yaml - Detects MD5, SHA1, DES, RC4 usage (CWE-327/328), includes comprehensive examples and remediation. 2) weak_randomness.yaml - Detects insecure random module usage for security-sensitive operations (CWE-338), provides alternatives using secrets module. 3) insecure_tempfile.yaml - Detects insecure tempfile usage including deprecated mktemp() and predictable filenames (CWE-377). 4) flask_request_validation.yaml - Detects missing request data validation in Flask, provides Pydantic and Marshmallow validation examples. 5) flask_session_security.yaml - Detects insecure session cookie settings (not HTTPS-only, not HttpOnly), weak secret keys. 6) flask_static_files.yaml - Detects path traversal vulnerabilities in static file serving, provides secure alternatives. 7) flask_json_deserialization.yaml - Detects insecure JSON handling, provides schema validation with Pydantic/Marshmallow. All patterns follow the established pattern schema with detection rules, remediation examples, attack vectors, and LLM prompts. Updated TODO.md to mark all 7 patterns as complete. All 550 tests still passing.
[what_did_not_work] = None. All patterns loaded and validated successfully by existing pattern loader tests.
[tests_passing] = All 550 tests passed (no regressions), pattern loader tests validated new patterns
[tests_failing] = None
[notes_for_next_agent] = Attack patterns (Phase 1.4, lines 309-325) significantly expanded. Now have 24 total patterns: 15 OWASP Top 10 + 5 Python-specific + 4 Flask-specific. Phase 1 is now ~86-88% complete. Next priorities: 1) Complete any remaining advanced Python patterns (decorator vulnerabilities, metaclass abuse, async vulnerabilities, generator vulnerabilities), 2) LLM Integration (1.5, lines 374-425) - entire section not started, 3) Core Infrastructure improvements (1.2) - secure credential storage, logging tests, error handling improvements.
