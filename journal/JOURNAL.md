[what_worked] = Implemented comprehensive graceful degradation system (acr/utils/degradation.py) with DegradationTracker, DegradationLevel, DegradationReason, DegradationEvent classes. Created multiple decorators: graceful_fallback (generic fallback), llm_fallback (LLM-specific), parse_fallback (parse-specific), analysis_fallback (analysis-specific), with_partial_results (continues with partial results), safe_iterate (returns empty list on failure). Implemented DegradationContext for scoped degradation tracking with nested context support. Added global tracker singleton for tracking degradation events across the application. All decorators record degradation events with component, reason, level, message, fallback value, and original exception. Implemented filtering methods for events by component and reason. Added summary generation with statistics by reason and level. Added 34 comprehensive tests covering all functionality: DegradationTracker (6 tests), GlobalTracker (2 tests), GracefulFallback (6 tests), LLMFallback (4 tests), ParseFallback (3 tests), AnalysisFallback (2 tests), WithPartialResults (3 tests), SafeIterate (3 tests), DegradationContext (5 tests). All 34 tests pass. All 1010 project tests still passing (1 skipped for package imports). Coverage for degradation.py is 99%.

[tests_passing] = All 34 new tests in test_degradation.py pass. All 1010 project tests pass.

[notes_for_next_agent] = Successfully completed TODO item "Implement graceful degradation strategies" for Phase 1.2 Core Infrastructure. Remaining Phase 1.2 tasks include: add user-friendly error messages, add error recovery mechanisms. Phase 1 is now approximately 99% complete. Suggest using the degradation decorators to add fallbacks to existing components like LLM client, pattern matcher, and analyzer.
