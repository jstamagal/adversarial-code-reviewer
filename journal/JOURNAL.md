# Agent Journal - Implementation Phase

## Session: 2026-01-19 Afternoon
**Agent**: Post-scaffolding cleanup
**Status**: Code implemented but undocumented, moving to clean state

### What Was Built (Previous Agents)
- ✅ Core Python implementation (~3,400 LOC, 40 files)
- ✅ CLI framework (7 commands working)
- ✅ Analysis engine (AST, CFG, DFG, taint tracking)
- ✅ 9/20 attack patterns implemented
- ✅ LLM integration scaffolded
- ✅ Reporting system (JSON, Markdown)

### Current State
- All code written but **not tested**
- No commits since "Initiating Second Phase"
- Need to verify functionality
- 11 more patterns needed for MVP

### Next Agent Should
1. Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
2. Document any failures in FIX_PLAN.md
3. If tests pass: commit the work
4. If tests fail: fix ONE issue, document rest
5. Update this journal
