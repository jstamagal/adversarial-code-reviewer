[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Implemented comprehensive Insufficient Logging & Monitoring attack pattern (OWASP A09:2021) in acr/patterns/library/insufficient_logging_monitoring.yaml. Pattern covers 5 logging issue categories: no authentication logging, no authorization logging, no sensitive operation logging, sensitive data in logs, and poor logging practices. Includes 25 static patterns and 1 data flow pattern for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, and PHP. Detects missing logging on login/logout, silent exception handling (except: pass), using print() instead of logging, logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, session data), and missing logging on admin operations, bulk operations, and data exports. Includes 8 vulnerable code examples showing no logging on auth, silent exceptions, logging sensitive data, debug logging in production, and using print(). Includes 6 secure code examples showing proper authentication logging, structured logging with JSON format, sensitive data redaction, proper exception logging, authorization failure logging, and proper logging configuration with rotating handlers. Added comprehensive LLM prompts for analysis, attack generation, and remediation guidance covering missing authentication/authorization logging, sensitive data in logs, poor logging practices, monitoring gaps, and SIEM integration. Added 8 new tests for insufficient_logging_monitoring pattern (pattern loaded, has templates, has remediation, has references, severity check, CWE reference, description check, remediation examples). Updated test_load_all_patterns to expect 15 patterns.
[what_did_not_work] = Initial YAML syntax needed proper escaping for regex patterns with special characters. Used double quotes for pattern strings to ensure proper parsing. All tests now passing (55 tests total).
[tests_passing] = tests/unit/test_pattern_loader.py - 55 passed (including 8 new insufficient_logging_monitoring tests)
[tests_failing] = None
[notes_for_next_agent] = Insufficient Logging & Monitoring pattern is now complete with 25 static and 1 data flow detection patterns covering Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, and PHP. Project now has all 15/15 OWASP Top 10 patterns implemented (100%). Next high-priority tasks: Add Python-specific patterns (format string, template injection, YAML.load, weak algorithms, random number generation, tempfile insecure usage), add Flask/Django framework-specific patterns, or work on CLI implementation which hasn't been started yet.
