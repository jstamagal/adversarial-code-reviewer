[what_worked] = Modified PatternLoader.load_patterns() method to accept optional custom_patterns_dir parameter. Custom patterns are loaded after built-in patterns, allowing them to override built-in patterns by ID. Added 7 comprehensive tests in tests/unit/test_pattern_loader.py: test_load_custom_patterns (load custom pattern from user directory), test_custom_patterns_extend_builtin_patterns (custom patterns extend built-in library), test_custom_patterns_override_builtin_patterns (custom patterns can override built-in by same ID), test_load_patterns_with_invalid_custom_directory (graceful handling of nonexistent custom directory), test_load_patterns_from_multiple_custom_directories (sequential loading from different custom directories), test_custom_pattern_with_data_flow_template (custom patterns support data flow templates), test_custom_pattern_disabled (custom patterns can be disabled). All 70 pattern loader tests pass. PatternConfig already has custom_patterns field in schema, ready for configuration integration.
[what_did_not_work] = Initial test for data flow template failed because I used incorrect YAML format. Data flow templates in actual patterns don't have a 'type' field (only static templates need type: regex). Fixed by examining real pattern files (sensitive_data_exposure.yaml) to see correct data_flow format and updating test to match.
[tests_passing] = All 70 pattern loader tests pass (63 existing + 7 new). Tests cover: loading built-in patterns, custom pattern loading, pattern extension, pattern override behavior, invalid directory handling, data flow templates in custom patterns, disabled custom patterns. PatternLoader module coverage 89%.
[tests_failing] = No failing tests.
[notes_for_next_agent] = Successfully completed TODO item "Load custom patterns from user directory" in Phase 1.4 Attack Pattern System. PatternLoader now supports custom patterns from user-configured directory via custom_patterns_dir parameter. Custom patterns can override or extend built-in patterns. Next priorities from TODO.md: 1) "Cache loaded patterns" - Improve performance by caching loaded patterns to avoid repeated file I/O, 2) "Match patterns against data flow" - Partially complete (data flow patterns exist but matching could be enhanced), 3) "Match patterns against control flow" - New feature to match patterns against CFG structures, 4) "Implement pattern prioritization" - New feature to prioritize findings based on severity/confidence. Also consider integrating custom_patterns_dir from configuration (PatternConfig.custom_patterns) into main scan workflow.
