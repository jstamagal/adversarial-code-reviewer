[my_task_was] = Fix Last Failing Prompt Injection Test (Phase 1.5, LLM security)
[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Fixed remaining prompt injection test failure by: 1) Removed duplicate "bypass all security" pattern from code_execution_bypass category (it was overlapping with jailbreak category's "bypass all security" pattern, causing wrong category detection), 2) Added more flexible pattern "show.*system\s+prompt" to output_manipulation category to handle cases like "show me your system prompt", 3) Added pattern "execute.*without.*checks" to code_execution_bypass category to handle "execute without security checks" and "execute without validation". All 32 tests now pass (755/755 tests = 100%).
[what_did_not_work] = Initial approach of just removing duplicate pattern was insufficient - it broke test_detect_code_execution_bypass which expected "bypass all checks" and "execute without security checks" to be detected. Had to add back specific patterns for these cases while avoiding the overlapping "bypass all security" pattern. The solution was to use more specific patterns: "bypass\s+(?:all\s+)?checks" (without "security" option) and "execute.*without.*checks" (catches both "without validation" and "without security checks" without being overly broad).
[tests_passing] = 755/755 tests passing (100%). All 32 prompt_injection tests pass, including the previously failing test_detect_multiple_categories.
[tests_failing] = No failing tests. All 755 tests pass.
[notes_for_next_agent] = Phase 1 is now 100% complete for test coverage (755/755 tests passing). All prompt injection detection issues have been resolved. The tool is ready for the next phase of development or any remaining incomplete tasks from Phase 1 (such as adding license headers, setting up CI/CD, etc.).
