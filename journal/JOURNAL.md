[my_task_was] = Implement dry run mode (--dry-run flag) for CLI with LLM cost estimation and analysis time estimates
[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Successfully enhanced the `acr scan --dry-run` command with three new features: 1) Added LLM pricing table with cost estimates for Anthropic and OpenAI models (8 models total), calculates cost based on 800 tokens average per finding, shows USD currency, 2) Added analysis time estimation based on file count (0.3s per file base, 0.15s per finding), adds 5s LLM response time per finding when LLM is enabled, displays in seconds or minutes depending on duration, 3) Added comprehensive dry run information table showing: Total Findings, LLM Integration status, Estimated LLM Cost (when enabled), Estimated Analysis Time. Includes warning when estimated cost exceeds $1.00 and helpful messages for no findings case. Added 4 comprehensive unit tests: test_cli_scan_dry_run_with_findings, test_cli_scan_dry_run_estimates_llm_cost, test_cli_scan_dry_run_no_findings, test_cli_scan_dry_run_with_filters. All 62 CLI tests passing (up from 58).
[what_did_not_work] = None. All tests passed on first run. Initial test failure was due to missing context object (ctx.obj) when invoking scan.cli directly, fixed by invoking through main() group which properly initializes the context. Minor LSP error about undefined functions that was resolved by fixing test invocation.
[tests_passing] = tests/unit/test_cli.py - 62 passed (100%)
[tests_failing] = None
[notes_for_next_agent] = CLI Implementation (Phase 1.6) continues to progress. Dry run mode is now complete with cost estimation and time estimates. Remaining CLI work in Phase 1.6: Add shell autocompletion (bash, zsh, fish) (TODO.md line 505-511). After CLI is complete, focus on Reporting System (Phase 1.7) - finding data model, finding aggregation, confidence scoring, false positive management, markdown/json report generators. Dry run mode provides helpful cost/time estimates to prevent unexpected expenses during full scans.
