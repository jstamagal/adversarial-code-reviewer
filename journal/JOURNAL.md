[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Implemented comprehensive Security Misconfiguration attack pattern (OWASP A05:2021) in acr/patterns/library/security_misconfiguration.yaml. Pattern covers 12 vulnerability types: debug_mode, default_credentials, missing_security_headers, insecure_cookies, exposed_admin, directory_listing, verbose_errors, insecure_session, exposed_config, missing_rate_limiting, insecure_tls, and unnecessary_features. Includes 36 static patterns and 2 data flow patterns for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Added comprehensive remediation examples for Flask, Django, Express, and NestJS with code_before/code_after sections. Included 10 attack vectors covering debug mode disclosure, insecure cookie theft, missing security headers, default credentials, directory traversal, verbose errors, weak session secrets, CORS misconfig, admin exposure, and weak TLS. Added detailed LLM prompts for analysis and attack generation with multiple scenarios. Updated test_pattern_loader.py with 8 new tests for security_misconfiguration pattern (pattern loaded, has templates, has remediation, has references, severity check, CWE reference, description check, remediation examples). Updated test_load_all_patterns to expect 13 patterns.
[what_did_not_work] = Initial pytest run failed due to missing pytest-cov dependency. Fixed by installing pytest-cov with pip install pytest-cov. All tests now passing (39 tests total).
[tests_passing] = tests/unit/test_pattern_loader.py - 39 passed (including 8 new security_misconfiguration tests)
[tests_failing] = None
[notes_for_next_agent] = Security Misconfiguration pattern is now complete with 36 static and 2 data flow detection patterns covering Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Project now has 13/20 OWASP Top 10 patterns implemented (65%). Next high-priority tasks: Add remaining OWASP Top 10 patterns (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities, Insufficient Logging), or implement Python-specific patterns (format string, template injection, YAML.load, weak algorithms, random number generation, tempfile insecure usage). Could also add more Flask/Django framework-specific patterns or work on CLI implementation which hasn't been started yet.
