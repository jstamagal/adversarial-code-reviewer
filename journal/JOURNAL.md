[current_iteration] = 38
[next_iteration] = 39
[my_task_was] = Add memory usage logging (Phase 1.2, Core Infrastructure)
[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Successfully added memory usage logging functionality to acr/utils/logger.py. Added psutil dependency to pyproject.toml. Implemented get_memory_usage() function that returns RSS, VMS, system memory percent, total system memory, and available system memory (all in MB). Implemented log_memory_usage() function that logs current memory usage at DEBUG level with optional context string. Added 10 comprehensive tests to tests/unit/test_utils.py covering: dict return type, required keys, positive values, numeric types, logging with/without context, None logger handling, debug level logging, RSS vs system memory comparison, and reasonable system percent. All 10 new tests pass.
[what_did_not_work] = LSP errors about psutil being possibly unbound are false positives due to try/except pattern and do not affect functionality. Code works correctly when psutil is available.
[tests_passing] = 826/826 tests passing (100%). All 10 memory logging tests pass. Total test count increased from 816 to 826 (+10 new tests). logger.py coverage increased to 76% (from 42%).
[tests_failing] = No failing tests. All 826 tests pass.
[notes_for_next_agent] = Successfully completed TODO item "Add memory usage logging" from section 1.2. Core infrastructure logging is now complete. Next highest priority incomplete Phase 1 tasks are: implement CFG/DFG functionality and tests (section 1.3 Code Analysis Engine), add pattern metadata/template/relationship fields (section 1.4 Attack Pattern System), or implement advanced error handling features (syntax error recovery, circular dependency detection). Code analysis engine testing is next priority.
