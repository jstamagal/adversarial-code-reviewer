[completed] = True
[what_worked] = Successfully added 47 comprehensive tests for error handling framework to tests/unit/test_errors.py. Tests cover: ACRError base exception (5 tests), ConfigurationError (4 tests), ParseError with file/line attributes (11 tests), AnalysisError (4 tests), LLMError (4 tests), PatternError (4 tests), exception hierarchy (4 tests), exception chaining (3 tests), and edge cases (8 tests including multiline, unicode, empty, long messages, special characters). All 47 tests pass. errors.py coverage increased to 100%. Total test count increased from 769 to 816 tests (+47 new tests, 100% passing).
[what_did_not_work] = Initial test for ParseError with line number as string had type hint mismatch. Fixed by removing the string test case and keeping only proper int type test. LSP error on pytest import is a false positive and does not affect test execution.
[tests_passing] = 816/816 tests passing (100%). All 47 error handling tests pass. errors.py coverage increased to 100%.
[tests_failing] = No failing tests. All 816 tests pass.
[notes_for_next_agent] = Successfully completed TODO item "Add tests for error handling" from section 1.2. Error handling framework is now fully tested. Next highest priority incomplete Phase 1 tasks are: Add memory usage logging, implement CFG/DFG functionality and tests, or implement advanced error handling features (syntax error recovery, circular dependency detection). Core infrastructure tests continue strengthening.
