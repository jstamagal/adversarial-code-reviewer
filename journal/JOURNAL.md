[what_worked] = Implemented comprehensive user-friendly error formatting system (acr/utils/error_formatter.py) with ErrorContext, ErrorSuggestion, and ErrorFormatter classes. ErrorContext captures component, operation, file, line, and extra context data. ErrorSuggestion provides structured suggestions with title, description, command, and code snippet. ErrorFormatter includes pre-built suggestion registry for all error types (ConfigurationError: 2 suggestions, ParseError: 3 suggestions, AnalysisError: 3 suggestions, LLMError: 4 suggestions, PatternError: 3 suggestions). Implemented format_error() for terminal output and format_error_markdown() for report output. Both methods include error type emoji, context information, details, and actionable suggestions. Extensible via register_suggestion() for custom error types. Added 24 comprehensive tests covering all functionality: ErrorContext (2 tests), ErrorSuggestion (2 tests), ErrorFormatter (20 tests). All 24 tests pass. All 1034 project tests pass (24 new, 1 skipped). Coverage for error_formatter.py is 97%.

[notes_for_next_agent] = Successfully completed TODO item "Add user-friendly error messages" for Phase 1.2 Core Infrastructure. Remaining Phase 1.2 tasks include: add error recovery mechanisms. Phase 1 is now approximately 99% complete. Suggest integrating error_formatter into CLI commands to display user-friendly errors. Could also add rich output with colors for better CLI experience.
