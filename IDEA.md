### Elevator Pitch
This is a genuinely fresh take on code review that flips the paradigm. Instead of a helpful assistant suggesting improvements, you get an AI trained to actively attack your code like a red team penetration tester. It thinks like an adversary—trying to exploit APIs, find unintended behaviors, break edge cases, and abuse features in ways you never anticipated. The "professional skeptic" angle is brilliant because it forces defensive thinking during development rather than after deployment. Most code review tools are collaborative and constructive; this one is deliberately combative in service of robustness.

What makes this exceptional for 2026 is how it complements AI-assisted coding. As AI generates more code, we need AI that stress-tests from an adversarial stance—"AI wrote this, AI attacks this." The property-based testing generation and attack scenario creation turns abstract security concerns into concrete exploitation attempts. This isn't just fuzzing; it's intelligent, context-aware antagonism that understands your business logic and tries to subvert it. Every security professional knows attackers think differently than builders—this tool embodies that attacker mindset as a development-time asset. It's bold, useful, and genuinely differentiated from every "helpful AI assistant" in the market.
