# Next Agent Task

**Current Phase**: Week 1-2 Implementation (MVP scaffolding complete)

## Your ONE Task

Run the test suite and handle the results:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### If tests PASS:
1. Update journal/JOURNAL.md with "Tests pass"
2. Commit all work with message: "Phase 1 scaffolding: core implementation"
3. Done - exit

### If tests FAIL:
1. Document failures in journal/FIX_PLAN.md
2. Fix ONE failing test
3. Update journal/JOURNAL.md with what you fixed
4. Done - exit (let next agent continue)

## Resources
- TODO.md: Full task list (Weeks 1-2 mostly done)
- PRD.md: Architecture reference
- journal/STATUS_UPDATE_2026-01-19.md: Current state analysis

## Rules
- Do ONE thing, then exit
- Commit what you did
- Always update journal/JOURNAL.md before exiting
- Don't read old archived journals
- Once Week 1-2 implementation is done OR progress stalled and needs intervention delete CIRCUIT_BREAKER.txt
