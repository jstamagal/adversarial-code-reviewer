- Read TODO.md 
- Read journal/JOURNAL.md
- Pick the next highest priority task to complete.
- Read PRD.md if you need to reference it.
- Use COG_TEMPLATE.txt as a template for journal entry
- append a report to journal/JOURNAL.md
- Remember to commit
- Only implement one thing, if it fails note it in your journal entry, if it succeeds note it in your journal entry and check it off on the list.
- Only delete CIRCUIT_BREAKER.txt if the situation is grave -- if the success of what the previous agent was working on isn't crucial then don't waste time on it.
